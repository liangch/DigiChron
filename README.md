**Clockface for Fitbit Versa**

## This clockface has two main views:

### 1. A simple and clean digital clock view showing
- the time in the middle (HH:MM)
- a slowly filling horizontal line denoting the seconds
- the date below
- a status bar on top:
  - LH corner: battery status
  - RH corner: heart rate
  
The time supports 24h and 12h format.
The day name supports DE (German) and EN (English) language. For all other, it defaults to english.
The date format supports US locale setting (M/D/YYYY), for all other locales, it defaults to D.M.YYYY

## Disclaimer:

The clockface was created as a hobby project.
I may or may not continue to work on it in the future.
Probably there will be some further version with some settings for color and with the support for more locales.
